                <div class="collapsible-header">Handtying</div>

                <div class="collapsible-body">
                    <p>Handtying is an ancient Celtic Tradition that dates back over 2000 years.
                        It was originally used to symbolise a betrothal. The engagement would last a year and a day and
                        at
                        the end of that term the couple would decide to marry or go their separate ways.</p>
                    <p>The hands, or
                        wrists, are tied together using ribbons or cords. The practice gave way to the expression “tying
                        the
                        knot” which now means getting married.</p>
                    <p>Usually ribbon or cord is used but some couples choose to use
                        fabric or lace which has some special meaning to them. Their hands are bound by the ribbons and
                        once
                        the binding has been completed the couple then keep the knotted fabric as a symbol or their
                        commitment and their wedding day.</p>

                <div class="collapsible-header">Sand Ceremony </div>

                <div class="collapsible-body">
                    <p>The Unity Sand Ceremony is a variation on the Unity Candle Ceremony. It is
                        a tradition full of symbolism.</p>
                    <p>The couple each pour a coloured sand from a smaller vessel into one
                        larger vessel. As the grains of sand intertwine it symbolises the joining together of the two
                        people
                        into one family through marriage.</p>
                    <p>This is a particularly lovely enhancement to include in your
                        ceremony for blended families with children. The vessel full of sand makes a beautiful keepsake
                        to
                        have in your family home.</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="collapsible-header">Unity Candle</div>

                <div class="collapsible-body">
                    <p>The Unity Candle Ceremony is a relatively new trend in Wedding Ceremonies.
                        It symbolises the joining together of two families, and their love for the couple, into one
                        united
                        family.</p>
                    <p>There are 3 candles used, one main candle and two smaller ones on either side. It is popular
                        for the mothers/parents of the couple to each light one of the smaller candles and then the
                        couple
                        will each hold their family’s candle and light the main candle together.</p>
                    <p>The beauty of the two
                        flames coming together is quite special. You can choose to recite some words during the
                        ceremony, or
                        your Celebrant can do this for you.</p>

                <div class="collapsible-header">Ring Warming</div>

                <div class="collapsible-body">
                    <p>This beautiful ritual is also known as the Blessing of the Rings.</p>

                    <p>Your wedding rings are passed around your chosen guests and warmed with their love, blessings and
                        positive energy. When the rings are returned to the Best Man in time for the ring exchange, they
                        contain something immensely powerful and very precious; the love and blessings from those whom
                        you love.</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="collapsible-header">Rose Ceremony</div>

                <div class="collapsible-body">
                    <p>During the Rose Ceremony the couple exchange two roses. This symbolises the giving and receiving
                        of their love for one another now and for the rest of their married life together.</p>

                    <p>The Rose is a symbol of love.</p>

                    <p>You could also adapt this lovely ceremony and perhaps include your mothers or another family
                        member in the ceremony.</p>

                    <p>This is an elegant enhancement that is sure to bring some extra romance to any ceremony.</p>

            <li>
                <div class="collapsible-header">Wine Box</div>

                <div class="collapsible-body">
                    <p>If you and your fiancé love wine, then this may be the perfect ceremony enhancement for you!</p>

                    <p>During this ceremony a box of wine is enclosed in usually a wooden box, personalised if you wish.
                        You could also write a love letter to each other and place it in the box also.</p>

                    <p>During this ceremony you are celebrating your love for one another on your wedding day and then
                        again on an anniversary in the future. On your 1st or 5th anniversary for example, you would
                        open the box and drink the wine together and read each other's letters. Just make sure you pick
                        a bottle of wine that will stand the test of time!</p>
